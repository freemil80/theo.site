## 📌 About Me

Hello, I am **Theophilus Agyekum**, a Chemistry graduate with a strong interest in scientific research and data analysis. 
My academic background, combined with technical training from the **Generation Ghana Data Analyst program**, equips me with 
the skills to support data-driven innovation. I am particularly passionate about applying data analytics in **organometallic research** 
to drive advancements in energy, medicine, and sustainable chemistry.

By integrating programming skills in Python and SQL with visualization tools like Power BI, I focus on uncovering insights from
scientific datasets, improving experimental efficiency, and enabling evidence-based discovery. I value scientific accuracy, critical 
thinking, and the translation of complex data into practical outcomes that support **real-world solutions**.
